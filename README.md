# Cross-expression
## Introduction
Spatial transcriptomic technologies measure gene expression in individual cells while recording their physical locations, allowing us to ask how cells influence one another within the tissue. To address this question, we introduce cross-expression, a novel conceptual and statistical framework to understand coordinated gene expression between cells. Whereas co-expression measures the degree to which the expression of two genes is coordinated within the same cells, cross-expression quantifies how their expression is associated across neighboring cells. Since two genes can trivially cross-express if they are co-expressed in neighboring cells, we define cross-expression mutually exclusively, where the target cell expresses gene A but not gene B and its neighbor expresses gene B but not gene A, thus revealing genuine coordination as opposed to simple co-localization. Here, we provide an efficient R package to perform cross-expression analysis, which makes pairwise comparisons between all genes and outputs a gene-by-gene p-value matrix indicating which pairs are significantly cross-expressed across the tissue. Rather than targetting previously known genes, our framework uses the high-throughput of spatial transcriptomics data to the fullest extent to discover spatial gene expression programs.
