# System Information
Software developed on and tested using R (version 4.4.1, 2024-06-14) on an Apple M1 Pro laptop with 16 GB RAM. The relevant R libraries and their dependencies are installed, if needed, and loaded automatically when sourcing the CrossExpression.R file. This process and/or the execution of each function should take a few seconds. Benchmarks for time complexity on datasets of various sizes is presented in the associated manuscript.
